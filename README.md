# UTA Bootcamp Challenge 04

In this homework assignment from the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp we were asked to create a short quiz with functioning buttons, scores stored, and a functioning High Score Page. 

Our instructor Leah Nelson helped us conceptualize the solution with some pseudo-code.

I also took many hints/tips/tricks from James Quick's video series on building a Quiz App.

Here are the given relevant assignment details:

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
